# A-New-Framework-for-Analyzing-Drill-String-Dynamics

Key Advantages:

Drill string dynamics calculations are fully based on the DEM engine.
The model automatically takes into account drill string eccentricity and structural damping.
Avoids shear locking based on the Timoshenko beam theory.
Realistic analysis of the mechanical behavior of the cross-section of the drill string by the ball-ring model.
Fatigue or failure of the drill string under different operating conditions can be captured by incorporating the bond failure criterion.
attention:

The research paper of the solver is under review, and only partial validation cases have been uploaded.

After the manuscript is accepted, the program developed in this work (A-New-Framework-for-Analyzing-Drill-String-Dynamics) will be freely accessed, and the link will be updated in this section of the proof version.

The software package is now being prepared and will be released soon.
